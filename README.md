# Coffee-Roaster-Cashier-System

This project is a **cashier system** developed for a coffee roaster, featuring two distinct user interfaces: **Manager** and **Worker**. It was built using **Java** for the application logic and **MySQL** as the database management system. The project provides an efficient way to handle products, purchases, sales, and inventory, with different access controls for workers and managers.

## Project Overview

### Manager Interface
The manager interface grants full administrative access, allowing the manager to:
- **Add or remove workers**
- **Monitor and manage purchases, sales, and inventory**
- **View reports and analytics related to sales and inventory**

### Worker Interface
The worker interface has limited functionality, where workers can:
- **Enter new products** into the inventory system
- **Record purchases** made by the coffee roaster
- **Manage sales** by entering customer orders
- **Track and update inventory** based on sales and purchases



## Features

1. **User Authentication**
   - Separate login screens for managers and workers.
   - Role-based access to different functionalities.
   
2. **Product Management**
   - Workers can add, update, or remove products.
   - Managers can view detailed product reports, including sales trends and stock alerts.

3. **Purchase and Sales Tracking**
   - Workers can enter purchases and record sales transactions.
   - Managers have access to view and edit sales and purchase histories.

4. **Worker Management**
   - Managers can add or remove workers, assign roles, and track worker activities.



## System Architecture

### Technologies Used
- **Java**: For application logic, business processing, and GUI development.
- **MySQL**: For managing data storage, ensuring persistence of products, sales, purchases, and user data.
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: Used to interact with the MySQL database, executing queries and retrieving data.
- **javafx**: Javaâ€™s GUI  used to design the user interfaces for both manager and worker portals.
